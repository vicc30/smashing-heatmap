# Smashing Magazine Heatmap

This is my solution for the project Design Teardown that is part of the [Odin Project - HTML and CSS Path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/html-and-css/lessons/design-teardown).

"In this simple project, you’ll be breaking apart the website for a popular design magazine with which you’re probably familiar by now – Smashing Magazine. The goal for this exercise is to start training yourself to think in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles.

Your job is to create a grayscale heat map of the website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy."

## Assignment

### Playing with Visual Hierarchy

* [x] Go to Smashing Magazine’s website and check out their homepage. Think about where your eye got drawn to first, second, and third on the page. What elements on the page carry the greatest visual weight?
* [x] Create a new HTML document.
* [x] Think about all the elements on the Smashing homepage and how they are grouped together.
* [x] Copy the basic structure of the page using empty semantic HTML elements that are appropriately sized and positioned.
* [x] Now make the background colors of those divs different shades of gray which correspond to their visual weight on the Smashing homepage. If you squint your eyes and look from your solution to their page, does your eye get drawn to the same places?

### Playing with Typography

* [x] Add in some meaningless text to those divs (whether copied from the homepage or a lorem ipsum generator) for the main headlines and paragraphs. You’ll obviously want to change the div backgrounds back to white for those elements. You only need to add text to the main content areas, don’t worry too much about the side areas and navigation.
* [x] Change around the font styles and weights and see how that affects the visual weight and feel of the page. You should see some major differences between using serif and sans-serif fonts as well as moving from font-weight 100 to 700.
* [x] Find a font/weight combination that approximates that of the original Smashing homepage and apply it to your solution.
* [x] Push your solution to GitHub.
